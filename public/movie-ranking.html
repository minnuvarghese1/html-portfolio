<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mission:Impossible</h3>
<p> Dead Reckoning Part One is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises.</p>
<h3>Insidious:The Red Door</h3>
<p>The film is a worthy sequel. He's a frightening, interesting plot. The actors played their roles perfectly. I really liked the ending. For fans of horror movies, the movie is definitely worth watching.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Oppenheimer actually delivers and delivers big time. I have been Nolan fan since 2006 Prestige and even tho, not everything he makes is perfect, this one hits the home run.</p>
